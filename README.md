# There are three classes: Goat, Alpaca, Camel. Goats attack with horns, Alpacas ram, and Camels camel. There are three types of enemies: Fox, Llama, and Chupacabra. Foxes bite, Llamas run things over, and Chupacabras suck. There are ten levels you can unlock for your attacks, each making them deal one more point of damage. Each enemy has 20 levels, each level being .5 points of damage. Enemies have up to 50 health, you can have up to 50.5. There are 30 rooms with crappy descriptions and a few enemies. Once you clear them all, you win. Hurray.
